## **Rust**

* [Generational Indices/Indexes](https://lucassardois.medium.com/generational-indices-guide-8e3c5f7fd594), I came across this term while watching [this video about using Rust for Game Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHYs-UqS458). Seems like a good way to implement ecs.

* [A Basic Introduction to OpenGL with Rust](https://dev.to/samkevich/learn-opengl-with-rust-creating-a-window-1792), this is a 2 part series about creating a window and using shaders in Rust.

## **C/C++**

* [Recreating Noita's Sand Simulation in C and OpenGL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLZjd_Y1gJ8), I always wondered how did they achieve this and the video is a great explanation of the simulation.
